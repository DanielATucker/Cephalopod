                      If you, as an individual reading these words do not take
                      the time to educate yourself on The effects that
                      capitalism has had, you are personally turning your back
                      on existence as a whole.

                    Capitalism faces as an economic system. An economic system
                    that is branded best in the world.

                  Within Capitalism, you buy things in order to live. At first
                  glance, this seems normal, "This is the way things have always
                  been" one might think, but that idea is completely debunked.
                  For example, Indigenous peoples globally, did not use money to
                  survive, instead they shared what they had as a community.{" "}
                </p>

                <p>
                  The point here, is that Capitalism is an idea that someone
                  came up with. That idea, that one must buy things in order to
                  live, has resulted in an unimaginably large amount of human,
                  animal, and ecological suffering and death paralleled only by
                  Mass Extinction events.

                  LMG is dedicated to showing how Capitalism has caused this,
                  and the much prettier note of what we can do to fix it.{" "}
