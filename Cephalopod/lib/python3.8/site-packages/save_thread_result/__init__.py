class ThreadWithResult(threading.Thread):
    '''
    The `threading.Thread` subclass ThreadWithResult saves the result of a thread
    as its `result` attribute - i.e. call `thread_with_result_instance_1.result`
    after `thread_with_result_instance_1` finishes running to get the return
    value from the function that ran on that thread:

    >>> thread = ThreadWithResult(
        target = my_function,
        args   = (my_function_arg1, my_function_arg2, ...)
        kwargs = {my_function_kwarg1: kwarg1_value, my_function_kwarg2: kwarg2_value, ...}
    )
    >>> thread.start()
    >>> thread.join()
    >>> thread.result # returns value returned from function passed in to the `target` argument!




    NOTE: As of Release 0.0.3, you can also specify values for
    the `group`, `name`, and `daemon` arguments if you want to
    set those values manually.

    For details about the interface features available from `threading.Thread`,
    see documentation under "Method resolution order" - accessible
    from the python interpreter with:
    help(ThreadWithResult)




    OVERVIEW:
    ThreadWithResult is a `threading.Thread` subclass used to save the
    result of a function called through the threading interface, since

    >>> thread = threading.Thread(
        target = my_function,
        args   = (my_function_arg1, my_function_arg2, ...)
        kwargs = {my_function_kwarg1: kwarg1_value, my_function_kwarg2: kwarg2_value, ...}
    )
    >>> thread.start()
    >>> thread.join()
    >>> thread.result # does not work!

    executes and returns immediately after the thread finishes,
    WITHOUT providing any way to get the return value
    from the function that ran on that thread.




    USAGE:
    The name of the function to run on a separate thread should
    be passed to `ThreadWithResult` through the `target` argument,
    and any arguments for the function should be passed in
    through the `args` and `kwargs` arguments.

    You can also specify `threading.Thread` attributes such as
    `group`, `name`, and `daemon` by passing in the value you want to
    set them to as keyword arguments to `ThreadWithResult`




    EXPLANATION:
    We create a closure function to run the actual function we want
    to run on a separate thread, enclose the function passed to
    `target` - along with the arguments provided to `args` and `kwargs` -
    inside the closure function, and pass the CLOSURE FUNCTION
    as the function to the `target` argument in the
    `super.__init__()` call to `threading.Thread`:
    super().__init__(group=group, target=closure_function, name=name, daemon=daemon)

    Since the function we want to run on a separate thread is no longer
    the function passed directly to `threading.Thread` (remember,
    we pass the closure function instead!), we save the result of
    the enclosed function to the `self.result` attribute of the
    instance.

    We use inheritance to initialize this instance with the
    closure function as the `target` function and no arguments
    for `args` or `kwargs` (since we pass
    the `args` and `kwargs` arguments to the original
    `target` function INSIDE the closure function).

    All other attributes (`group`, `name`, and `daemon`)
    are initialized in the parent `threading.Thread` class
    during the `super().__init__()` call.




    NOTE that with release 0.0.7, you can also specify if
    you want the ThreadWithResult instance to log when the
    thread starts, ends, and how long the thread takes to execute!


    If you want to mute logging this message to the terminal for all
    ThreadWithResult instances, set the
    `log_thread_status` class attribute to False:

    >>> ThreadWithResult.log_thread_status = False


    If you only want to mute logging this message to the terminal for
    a specific instance of ThreadWithResult, set the
    `log_thread_status` attribute for the specific instance to False:

    >>> thread_with_result_instance.log_thread_status = False

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | Keep in mind python prioritizes the `log_thread_status` instance attribute |
    | over the `log_thread_status` class attribute!                              |
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------



    If you want to log this message to an output file (or multiple output files)
    for all ThreadWithResult instances, set the
    `log_files` class attribute to an iterable object contatining
    objects that support the .write() method:

    >>> ThreadWithResult.log_files = [file_object_1, file_object_2]


    If you only want to log this message to an output file (or multiple output files)
    for a specific instance of ThreadWithResult, set the
    `log_files` attribute for the specific instance to an iterable
    object contatining objects that support the .write() method:

    >>> thread_with_result_instance.log_files = [file_object_1, file_object_2]

    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    | Keep in mind python prioritizes the `log_files` instance attribute |
    | over the `log_files` class attribute!                              |
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------



    NOTE: since python prioritizes instance attributes over class attributes,
    if both the instance attribute and class attribute are set to different values,
    python uses the value set for the instance attribute.
    For more information, look up:
      - class attributes vs instance attributes in python
      - scope resolution using the LEGB rule for python

    Also note, by default the `log_thread_status`
    class attribute is set to `True`, and the `log_files`
    class attribute set to `None` - neither attributes
    exist as instance attributes by default!

    For an example that uses this logging feature in a real application, see how
    the `create_list_from()` method of the ListCreator class uses ThreadWithResult
