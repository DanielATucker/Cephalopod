This is a bundle of several packages that you can use as a shortcut in the
requirements lists of your applications.  Bundles are used to follow a
common group of packages, or a package with an optional extension feature.

You can install all of the packages in this bundle by,

*using pip*::

    $ pip install -U celery-with-redis

or *using easy_install*::

    $ easy_install -U celery-with-redis

Or if you want to add this bundle as a dependency in your application, you
can add the following identifier in your ``setup.py``'s requires list or
in your pip requirements files::

    celery-with-redis

You can also specify a specific version::
