                      Within Capitalism, you buy things in order to live. At
                      first glance, this seems normal, "This is the way things
                      have always been" one might think, but that idea is
                      completely debunked. For example, Indigenous peoples, at
                      least those of North America, did not use money to
                      survive, instead they shared what they had as a community.{" "}

                      The point here, is that Capitalism is an idea that someone
                      came up with. That idea, that one must buy things in order
                      to live, has resulted in an unimaginably large amount of
                      human, animal, and ecological suffering and death
                      paralleled only by Mass Extinction events.{" "}

                      Anarcho-Syndicalism, the biggest decisions in society are
                      made by the specific workers in it's respective industry.{" "}

                      stage.{" "}
