                    Within Capitalism, you buy things in order to live. At first
                    glance, this seems normal, "This is the way things have
                    always been" one might think, but that idea is completely
                    debunked. For example, Indigenous peoples globally, did not use money to survive, instead they
                    shared what they had as a community.{" "}

                    The point here, is that Capitalism is an idea that someone
                    came up with. That idea, that one must buy things in order
                    to live, has resulted in an unimaginably large amount of
                    human, animal, and ecological suffering and death paralleled
                    only by Mass Extinction events.{" "}
